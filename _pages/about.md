 I got a stretched-out collar, taking derivatives and working out basslines, riding around the merry-go-round with mulberry stains on white nikes, basketball-dribbling *through* the horse's legs. You hop on the antipodal horse, a bit of sawdust on your forearms from the shop's morning work, hair a bit long with specs of kelp in the roots, a poem in loose gym short pockets. Between us a fan of jockeys sweep around. We catch glimpses of them. Purple hair, a wetsuit, Statistical Mechanics textbook, turmeric stain, a bald spot, flat shoes with no laces, SoCal themed cruiser board, a glistening pizza *neopolitana*. Cottonwood pollen rains down, just as the ragweed used to, just as the cedar.

Someone said I should be able to explain my research to my grandparents, so here it is in 3 levels:

1. Is there *any* potential for super-quadratic speedups using quantum computers for combinatorial optimization problems or spin-glasses from condensed matter physics?

2. If we make a new type of computer, our of extremely tiny, finely controlled components that behave like quantum particles, could we use that computer to do things better than regular computers? Things like making industrial processes more efficient? 

3. You know that abacus you had on your desk? What if the beads could exist in many places at the same time? Could we use that to make international shipping routes better? (hopefully the sarcasm is palpable)

I am currently trying to answer these questions at the Computer Science Department in the University of Chicago. I am advised by Fred Chong and supported by NSF GRFP.
