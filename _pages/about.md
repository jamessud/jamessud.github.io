Hi! I'm a first year PhD in Computer Science at the University of Chicago under Professor Fred Chong with an interest in quantum algorithms, information, and systems; supported by the NSF GRFP Fellowship. I'm currently living in Chicago with my fiancee Maya Chan Morales, a Clinical Psychology PhD candidate at University of Illinois, Chicago, and our dog Zion. Previously, I have been affiliated with UC Berkeley, the Universities Space Research Association, the NASA Quantum AI Lab, the Los Alamos National Lab, and the Berkeley Lab. I am also in a neo-soul/jazz band based in the San Francisco Bay area, and love woodworking, surfing, skating, basketball, jazz, world music, hip hop, soul, spicy food, sweets, beaches, salt, indie movies, painting, creative writing, walking, and sleeping.
