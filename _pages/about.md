 Talk to me if you love smelling flowers, breathing and walking deeply, perfecting your jump shot, or researching quantum algorithms.
 
 I'm currently practicing all of the above, the last one via a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Chicago under Professor Fred Chong - supported by the NSF GRFP Fellowship. 

 It is my hope to update this page with poetry, music, visual art, and scientific publications as they come along. Find these on my blogroll. If anything interests you, don't be shy to send an email my way.
