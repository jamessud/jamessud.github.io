 Talk to me if you love chasing endless summers, smelling cedar shavings, stewing up soulful polyrhythms, brewing herbal teas, perfecting your jump shot, or researching quantum algorithms.
 
 I'm currently practicing all of the above, the last one via a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Chicago under Professor Fred Chong â€” supported by the NSF GRFP Fellowship. 

 Enjoy my offerings of poems, stories, and crafts in the flowers section, and find publications, talks, etc everywhere else.
