 I got a stretched-out collar, taking derivatives and working out basslines, riding around the merry-go-round with mulberry stains on white nikes, basketball-dribbling *through* the horse's legs. You hop on the antipodal horse, a bit of sawdust on your forearms from the shop's morning work, hair a bit long with specs of kelp in the roots, a poem in loose gym short pockets. Between us a fan of jockeys sweep around. We catch glimpses of them. Purple hair, a wetsuit, Statistical Mechanics textbook, turmeric stain, a bald spot, flat shoes with no laces, SoCal themed cruiser board, a glistening pizza *neopolitana*. Cottonwood pollen rains down, just as the ragweed used to, just as the cedar.
