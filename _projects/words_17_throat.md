In the late spring, when my windows are open (the ones that face south), the westward lake winds curl up through bricks and trees to reach my collar. I like to eat Alphonso mangoes around 1PM, at the height of the gusts. I eat them the way my dad taught me – by kneading the wide faces with my palm until the pulp turns into liquid, then biting off the pruned stem to form a small hole, then drinking through the hole like a CapriSun with no straw. 

This way the sugar crash drops me gently into a midday nap.

*Mini holding breath or breathing*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *in an out.*

*Walking down the staircase hearing:*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;*“you bitch, don’t walk away!”*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *“you bitch!”*

*No moment of stopping and turning around at the bottom of a stairwell or outside the door or the sidewalk crying.*

*Thinking about walking back home, sticking their thumb in their throat right at the crab apple.*

<br/>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *Crab apples in the throat,*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *thumb in the throat,*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *toes pointed out, one to*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *the front door,*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *one back home*.

<br/>

*Home: A glass bong with three college boys – turning periwinkle, spending their evening with Haribo gummies and long rainbow sour soft candy Erudite. Talking to a splayed, slippery candy wrapper dusted in sour granules and sugar granules.*

<p><center> ~ * ~ </center></p>

The pollen carries through three open windows, so my nose swells shut and I breathe through my mouth. When I wake up, my throat is dry and the pulpy thread still rests lingers astringent.
