Personal reading list. Organized first by genre (mainly fiction), second by area/people of origin, and third by authors who I choose to highlight. This isn't to ascribe more weight to the author's identity than the work itself – especially in fiction, where imaginiation triumphs. But we notice mores emerge: where the author spends their time, or how much time they are willing to spend! This isn't all the books I've read, but all the ones that played a large role in shaping my sensibilities, for better or for worse.
