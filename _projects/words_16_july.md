#### Untitled
<br/>

And then we were all put in boxes... 

(except for a couple wandering rebels who smoked hand-rolled cigarretes out of their mom’s Subarus and careened through the streets like charged-up billiard balls)

#### Hot July
<br/>

The hotter July gets,

(Its feverishly sizzling with old men-leaders and invisible terrors)

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; – the more we have to open our windows to let “breeze” in.

Its a greenhouse in here,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; with moist windows.

We’re breathing cotton-mouthed cactus breath.

The outside air is sweating with over-boiled tension.

<br/>

July is hotter than ever

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and we open our windows for air.

#### East Palo Alto
<br/>

Police vans swarm

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; like frontline combat jeeps and maggots,

when a firecracker,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; half the size of a pea,

is thrown onto the silky new asphalts streets,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; by a group of teenage boys

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; stooped on the curb by their mama’s Mercedez Benz.

<br/>

Whatsapp and Nextdoor chats ignite

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and start to buzz,

&emsp;&emsp; in the rugged streets of East Palo Alto,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; "the Kabul of Silicon Valley."
