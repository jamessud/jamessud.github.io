In summer nights

of San Diego

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; you need no blanket

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; to curl into your arms

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and clutch into your chest.

<br/>

They sat

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; with their heels pressed onto the edge of

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; sandstone cliffs.

	They didn’t need blankets,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; their faces opened up to the black Pacific Ocean

chewing peppermint gum.

<br/>

He asked him how far he could spit

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; his peppermint gum.

He asked him if he wanted to bet.

He told him to set the stakes.

He said if he makes it past the rocks below,

you kiss me.

If I don’t,

I kiss you.

He smiled and said 

lets play the game.

<br/>

And it was dark,

so the game became a silly slip

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; towards a kiss

sprinkled with salt

and artificial peppermint.
