In summer nights

of Baja California

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; you need no blanket

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; to curl into your arms

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and clutch into your chest.

<br/>

They sat

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; with their heels pressed onto the edge of

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; sandstone cliffs.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; They didn’t need blankets,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; their faces opened up to the black Pacific Ocean

chewing peppermint gum.

<br/>

He asked him how far he could spit

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; his peppermint gum.

He returned:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Let's bet?

He told him to set the stakes.

He said if he makes it past the rocks below,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; you kiss me.

If I don’t,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I kiss you.

He smiled and said 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; lets play.

<br/>

And it was dark,

so the landing spot was shrouded,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and the game became a silly lean

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; towards a kiss

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;sprinkled with salt

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and artificial peppermint.
