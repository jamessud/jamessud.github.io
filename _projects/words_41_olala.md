I zoomed home by moonlight.

These days are long, we stretch them with our stories.

My aimless wanderer mind keeps tumbling to your shores and watching the horizon and sometimes falling asleep.

The full moon finally came, 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and so did the new nikes.

I watch it and I open them and I smile. 

The full moon came,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and so did the new nikes,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and so did you.
