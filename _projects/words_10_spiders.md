The earth might as well be made of clay.

It doesn’t just form so fluidly under spinning wheels and stable hands.

It bakes for days on end,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; turns red and sometimes cracks.

At noon it burns, and at dusk the deep hidden warmth hangs like candlelit lanterns

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; ...and the spiders all know,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; that when the sky is perfect purple,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the earth is a cozy crib,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; for webs and beddings,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and curling up to the baked clay.


To scatter about the dancefloor,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; nuzzle and sweet-talk their

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; lovebugs,

and dream of building webs to the moon.
