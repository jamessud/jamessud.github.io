The earth might as well be made of clay

It doesn’t just form so fluidly under spinning wheels and stable hands

It bakes for days on end

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Turns red and sometimes cracks

At noon it burns and at dusk the deep hidden warmth hangs like candlelit lanterns

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; ...and the spiders all know

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; That when the sky is perfect purple

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The earth is a cozy crib

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; For webs and beddings

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And curling up to the baked clay


To scatter about the dancefloor

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Nuzzle and sweet-talk their

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Lovebugs


And dream of building webs to the moon
