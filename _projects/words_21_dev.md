Didn’t pops come too far for this?

Inside with water droplets suspended in air pushing thirty C.

Back flat on the itchy carpet floor, stretching my right hand over my body to the left, bicep on forehead sticky, I need the weight.
Can’t even pick myself up, get to the window. 

Outside its dust anyway, smog or wildfire smoke or – .

The ceiling fan is just droning like –

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; it feels like its slowing down like a –

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; long walk through the desert getting heat stroke.

These water droplets entered through my nose and the heat made them expand in my sinus. They’re pressing my nose, my ears, my temples – they vibrate hot.
