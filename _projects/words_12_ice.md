#### Untitled
<br/>

I am learning 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; to be slippery

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; like ice in the sun.

#### Untitled
<br/>

the air is frigid,

so sitting on this concrete bench my thighs feel wet.

<br/>

I feel my flesh is no warmth,

my hand is a bundle of bones.

<br/>
 
the windchills 

spark direct to my nerves,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; wrapped around tendon,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; wrapped around bone.

#### Tango
<br/>

These nights I hold hands with the sun.

Two hands enlocked, one arm bent

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; one straight.

She gives me a twirl,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and I wake up dizzily in the morning.

#### The Dells
<br/>

the highways are not smooth,

and through the window there are house-boxes

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; with torn roofs,

folded between layers of blanched dead winter corn,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; barren greyscale trees,

and washed out clouds,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; drained of blue.

<br/>

#### Vigil
<br/>

Palms are open

they hold candles

small so the flames 

dwell in the center of the cup.

<br/>

February in Chicago

palms are cups

hold the small flame 

safe from the wind.

<br/>

Wind drifts through fingers

pinches out the flame

hands get cold

loss of life.

<br/>

*Allah, let us pass this test*

gathered in a circle not well-formed

eyes are down

starting at fire.

<br/>

Don’t go out

flame

*don’t go out*.

<br/>

Standing in winter

standing in Chicago

the flames go out.

<br/>

The chaplain keeps praying 

so does the priest

*Amen*.

<br/>

Beyond the misshapen circle

the flags ruffle but never lift

the flags of Syria and Turkey

who’s children speak

looking down without tears. 

<br/>

The Chicago wind spirals

into our palms

pinches out the flame and a tear.

<br/>

Our fingers start to freeze

we turn to our neighbors to relight the flame

#### Rock Slides
<br/>

In my hometown

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the sandstone and limestone cliffs lean over the shoreline,

undercut by windswells and the king tide.

Sometimes rocks would tumble downwards,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and buttes would shear and fall.

Here, now,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; windowed steel and concrete cliffs stand perfectly straight

over the lakes edge.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And sometimes people fall.
