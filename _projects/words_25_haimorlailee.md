Haimoreleilee runs like his feet are kegs of dynamite and his arms are a hang glider,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and like he saw the Rebirth through his elephant eyes.

Haimoreleileeâ€™s tan bandana is not like a ninja,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; nor a kufi nor a turban.

He fastened it on his his smooth forehead,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; squeezing out a thumb-sized bubble of sweat,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; the day he heard his father declare he was at war with himself, cutting off the tip of his nose, ears, fingers, and toes.

The sword hangs above their kitchen,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; along saucepans and large metal spoons

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; that clang when the house shudders.

He wants to be a bright orange hang glider that burns through beige cliffs,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and like dinosaurs crumble when the dynamite blows.
