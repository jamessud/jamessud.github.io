Colors change shape

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; change size

these days I only want you to see me

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; underwater

these days I want to speak with the voice of a muddy

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; bass clarinet

I sit, take off my glasses

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and rub glitter into my eye

my arches are strained

my feet are large and 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I’m feeling these muscles and wondering

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; who I’ve sculpted
