#### Hill Dusty

*Through a dusty film camera, hand-held,*

*projected on beige walls,*

*we watch our distant hero.*

<br/>

His sun-beaten brown shirtless chest,

grainy white tube socks,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  and patched up trick deck

<br/>

drops in 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  on a hellish hill

potholes and everything –

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; almost vertical

almost clipping his wings and yanking him down

stretching out his knotty hair behind his zooming figure

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; like the cords of a parachute.

<br/>

*We all lean forward*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *to balance out the acceleration.*

<br/>

His body buzzes down the gritty asphalt

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; – suspended knees

he’s halfway down the hill

and through a cross-street in the foreground

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; rolls a 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; *black-white-and-blue*

<br/>

and while his legs and feet wobble

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; our hero holds his stance against all physics,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; – raising his right arm

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  straight up over his chest

and unleashes the bird.

<br/>

*We raise our arms and holler,*

*and lie back into our stances*

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  *knowing our hero can fly.*

#### Gnats

in those summers it almost seemed like forgoing sunscreen and 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; tumbling 30 feet down

95-degree heat-absorbent gritty asphalt hills 

would do for us what

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; $200/week exfoliation and moisturizer routines did for the hot girls and their moms
