Here’s a little blue boy dressed in light blue size 2 jeans
squirming in the sandbox, flailing and spinning
with black speckles on coarse beige sands stuck between his undies and the denim
caught in his socks and overalls
irritating that soft childish skin
with the stupid face of way too happy children drooling everywhere.

And he looks a few feet past the grey dirt border around his sandbox his parents designed
into the little area of grass between the bushes
And sees a stick – 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a perfect one
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; so perfectly straight and manly and devoid of those
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; pretty little curved branches.
So he somehow
unstably
gets up and
picks up the stick
and waddles back to the sandbox.
Raises it up
and with all his might shoves it as hard as he can down into the sandbox.


And two men in business suits
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; dark black businessmen briefcases
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and clipboards

pause for a minute in reverent
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (self-conscious)
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; silence.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Grasping for meaning, for thesis, in this simple,
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; spiny structure

and declare it
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; “THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT”
