And then we were all put in boxes... 

(Except for a couple wandering rebels who smoked hand-rolled cigarretes out of their mom’s Subarus and careened through the streets like charged-up billiard balls)

The hotter July gets

(Its feverishly sizzling with old men-leaders and invisible terrors)

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; – The more we have to open our windows to let “breeze” in.

Its a greenhouse in here,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; With moist windows

We’re breathing cotton-mouthed cactus breath

The outside air is sweating with over-boiled tension

July is hotter than every

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And we open our windows for air
