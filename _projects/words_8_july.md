#### Untitled
<br/>

And then we were all put in boxes... 

(Except for a couple wandering rebels who smoked hand-rolled cigarretes out of their mom’s Subarus and careened through the streets like charged-up billiard balls)

#### Hot July
<br/>

The hotter July gets

(Its feverishly sizzling with old men-leaders and invisible terrors)

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; – The more we have to open our windows to let “breeze” in.

Its a greenhouse in here,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; With moist windows

We’re breathing cotton-mouthed cactus breath

The outside air is sweating with over-boiled tension

July is hotter than ever

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And we open our windows for air


<br/>

#### East Palo Alto
<br/>

Police vans swarm

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; like frontline combat jeeps and maggots

when a firecracker

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; half the size of a pea

is thrown onto the silky new asphalts streets

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; by a group of teenage boys

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; stooped on the curb by their mama’s Mercedez Benz

<br/>

Whatsapp and Nextdoor chats ignite

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; start to buzz

&emsp;&emsp; in the rugged streets of East Palo Alto

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; "the Kabul of Silicon Valley"
