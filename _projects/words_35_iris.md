Iris used to draw in the sandbox.

She placed her circular house in the middle of a dusty dune,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; on a ledge flattened by slicing wind,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; because she used to feel like a juillienned carrot,

whenever she went outside.

<br/>

She had a little brother who she called her “pupil.” 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And he loved to sit by the sandbox, 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and worm his way into the dirt until only his butt remained.
