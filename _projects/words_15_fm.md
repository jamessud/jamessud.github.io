Colors change shape

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; change size.

These days I only want my form to shimmer

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; underwater.

These days I want to speak with the voice of a muddy

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; bass clarinet.

I sit, take off my glasses

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; and rub glitter into my eye.

My arches are strained,

my feet are large and 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I’m feeling these muscles and wondering

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; who I’ve sculpted.
