Laila found herself flattened 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; on a tickly green field,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; looked up and saw the sky had turned to bricks,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; arched all over her,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; massive and imposing,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; creased her eyebrows and frowned.

Her mouth was stuffed with lavender,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; her ears with dried sage.

Laila loved the hills, brush,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; -	used to tend to the jasmine and inhale.

Til her landlord found her on one knee,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; nurturing,

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; put his hand on the shoulder opposite the knee

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; - set her tumbling thorugh a large large valley

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; on the bluest day of spring.

She rembembers seeing the wise eye of a bunny as 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; she fell and now feels

hazy like a cloud

or a dream.
