Iris used to draw in the sandbox
She placed her circular house in the middle of a dusty dune
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; On a ledge flattened by slicing wind
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Because she used to feel like a juillienned carrot
Whenever she went outside

She had a little brother who she called her “pupil” 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And he loved to sit by the sandbox 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; And worm his way into the dirt until only his but remained
